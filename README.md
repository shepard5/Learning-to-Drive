Playing around with different NN libraries and exploring their capabilities

"Learning to Drive 3.0" trains a car via a reward system and adjusting NN gradients to minimzie MSE of q values i.e. future action taken to maximize rewards moving forward. Adjusting reward system and providing additional information for the model to make decisions.
